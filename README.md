# OpenTickets
An Open Source event ticketing system

Currently just a placeholder.

Existing ticket systems seem focussed on either conferences or ticket sales, and all seem to have shortcomings. 

Opentickets intends to handle events differently, approaching events management from the view of local bands and small music venues. That means we want the following functionality, some or all of which is missing from existing solutions: 

* Organiser, Performer and Venue are all separate and optional entities, and all can be linked to multiple events. 
* All parties to an event (Organiser, Venue and Performer) can all have separate profiles with their own upcoming events (Where's my favourite band playing? What's my favourite venue hosting this month? Who's performing at my local comedy night this week?)
* Tickets are optional, but sales can be supported either directly or via links to a third party
* Third party product plugins (Wordpress etc)
* Full API for integration or complete front end customisation
